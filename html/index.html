    <h1>Henna Banna </h1>
  <p><h1>How Henna Works</h1> </p>  
<p>The natural dye within the henna plant begins to release once it has been mixed with liquid through a process known as oxidation. Over time, usually a period of 24-48 hours, the dye content in the henna paste will peak, where it will stain the darkest, and then slowly deteriorate over time.
</p>
<p>
Henna stains your skin. The top layers of skin absorb the henna dye. As your skin exfoliates, the henna stain will fade. The henna dye is also transparent, meaning it sits on top of your skin like a lens, adding color to your beautifully natural skin color. Every person's skin will reflect a slightly different shade. The henna stain color will always range from a bright pumpkin orange to a dark red or mahogany brown.
</p>
<p>
Henna stain results depend on the your skin type and where you place the design. Dry skin areas like hands and feet stain the darkest. Oily skin areas can be more difficult to achieve a dark stain. Henna stain results can also be effected by your body temperature. If you are cold, your pores contract, not allowing the henna to be absorbed into the skin, and will not result in a very dark color. It is best to keep warm after you receive henna.
